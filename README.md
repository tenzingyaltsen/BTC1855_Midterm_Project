# BTC1855_Midterm_Project

Plan:
1. Clean data in a R script for each data set and push to main branch.
2. Clone main branch for each subsequent task. Merge with main branch once complete.
3. Perform EDA using resource given in assignment. Branch is named "exploratory_data_analysis".
4. Remove "cancelled" trips. Record removed ids. Branch is called "cancelled_trips".
5. Identify outliers and record ids of outliers removed. Branch is called "outliers".
6. Find hours of weekdays where trip volume is the highest (i.e., rush hours). Branch is called "rush_hours".
7. Find 10 most frequent starting and ending stations during weekday rush hours and separately, the weekends. Branches are called "frequent_stations_weekdays" and "frequent_stations_weekends", respectively.
8. Calculate average utilization of bikes for each month. Branch is called "average_utilization".
9. Create new data set by combining trip and weather data, based on joining on common variables: city and date. Create a correlation matrix to ascertain correlations between variables given and variables related to bike rental patterns - flag highest correlations. Branch is called "correlations".
