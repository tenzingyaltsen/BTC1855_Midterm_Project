Plan:
1. Clean data in a R script for each data set and push to main branch.
2. Clone main branch for each subsequent task. Merge with main branch once complete.
3. Perform EDA using resource given in assignment.
4. Remove "cancelled" trips. Record removed ids. 
5. Identify outliers and record ids of outliers removed.
6. Find hours of weekdays where trip volume is the highest (i.e., rush hours).
7. Find 10 most frequent starting and ending stations during weekday rush hours and separately, the weekends.
8. Calculate average utilization of bikes for each month.
9. Create new data set by combining trip and weather data, based on joining on common variables: city and date. Create a correlation matrix to ascertain correlations between variables given and variables related to bike rental patterns - flag highest correlations.
